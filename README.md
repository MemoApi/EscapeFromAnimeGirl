# EscapeFromAnimeGirl<br/>
I used unity AI while making this game <br/>
I uploaded characters from asset store and added animation with mixamo <br/>
Thisis a simple shooter game, we just shoot fruit instead of bullets <br/>
And it's the anime girls chasing us <br/>
and I also used shader from asset store for Skybox <br/>
